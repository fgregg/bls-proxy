# BLS CORS Proxy, with caching

The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm">US Bureau of Labor Statistics has very nice web API</a>. Unfortunately, BLS has not set up CORS headers that would allow web developers to easily load BLS data into other sites.

This is the code for [proxy of the BLS's API that adds open CORS headers, with caching](https://bls-api.bunkum.us/).
